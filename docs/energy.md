# Energy requirements

- Each FROG launch requires \( 10 \text{ MJ} \) of energy.
- ODDS must generate this energy within 1 hour to allow continuous launches.
This is achieved through:
- \( 2.78 \text{ kW} \) of continuous power
- \( 13.89 \text{ m}^2 \) of space-grade solar panels
- \( 115,207 \) A123 (26650) batteries
- The system is scalable, ensuring that ODDS can operate autonomously for extended periods.

## Detailed breakdown:

To increase FROG’s velocity by 1 km/s, the required kinetic energy is given by: \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \).

For a 20 kg FROG: \( KE = 10,000,000 \text{ Joules} (10 \text{ MJ}) \).

This means that \( 10 \text{ MJ} \) of energy must be supplied to achieve a 1 km/s velocity increase.

## High-power batteries

- A123
- 26650

These batteries can withstand 1 second currents of \( 70 \text{ A} \).

## Acceleration Time and Force Calculation for FROG Launch

Using the kinematic equation: \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \).

Since initial velocity \( u = 0 \), it simplifies to: \( a = \frac{v^2}{2s} \).

We find:

- **Acceleration (a):**
  - For a 50 m Gauss gun: \( a = \frac{(1000 \text{ m/s})^2}{2 \times 50 \text{ m}} = 10,000 \text{ m/s}^2 \).
  - For a 300 m Gauss gun: \( a = \frac{(1000 \text{ m/s})^2}{2 \times 300 \text{ m}} = 1,667 \text{ m/s}^2 \).

- **Time required to reach 1 km/s:**
  - For a 50 m Gauss gun: \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{1000 \text{ m/s}}{10,000 \text{ m/s}^2} = 0.1 \text{ seconds} \).
  - For a 300 m Gauss gun: \( t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{1000 \text{ m/s}}{1,667 \text{ m/s}^2} = 0.6 \text{ seconds} \).

This confirms that acceleration occurs in much less than one second, meaning the batteries must discharge their energy in a very short burst.

## Power Requirement for FROG Acceleration

Assuming an acceleration time of 0.4 seconds, the required power to deliver \( 10 \text{ MJ} \) of energy is:

\[
P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{10,000,000}{0.4} = 25,000,000 \text{ Watts (25 MW)}
\]

This means the batteries or power system must supply \( 25 \text{ MW} \) for a short burst of \( 0.4 \text{ seconds} \).

## Battery Requirement for FROG Acceleration

Given that each A123 (26650) battery operates at \( 3.1 \text{ V} \) and can provide \( 70 \text{ A} \) for a short burst:
- Power per battery = \( 3.1 \text{ V} \times 70 \text{ A} = 217 \text{ W} \)
- Total power required = \( 25 \text{ MW} \)
- Number of batteries needed = \( \frac{25,000,000 \text{ W}}{217 \text{ W}} \approx 115,207 \text{ batteries} \)

This is a huge number of batteries, indicating that alternative energy storage methods (such as supercapacitors or higher-capacity battery packs) might be necessary for practical implementation.

## Total Battery Weight

The \( 115,207 \) A123 (26650) batteries required for FROG’s acceleration would weigh approximately \( 8,756 \text{ kg} (8.76 \text{ metric tons}) \).

This weight is manageable for a space-based system, but it does highlight the need for careful integration into ODDS to ensure mass distribution and structural feasibility.

## Solar Panel Requirements for 1-Hour Battery Recharge

To fully recharge all 115,207 batteries within 1 hour, the system would need:
- \( 2.78 \text{ kW} (2778 \text{ W}) \) of continuous power
- \( \sim 13.89 \text{ m}^2 \) of space-grade solar panels (assuming \( 200 \text{ W/m}^2 \) efficiency)

This is a moderate solar array size, making it feasible for ODDS to recharge within an hour.
