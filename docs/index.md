# ODDS+FROG

## The Problem: Space Debris and Its Growing Threat

Space debris — fragments of defunct satellites, rocket stages, and other remnants of human activity — poses a serious risk to operational spacecraft, satellites, and even future space missions.

- Increasing Density: With thousands of objects in orbit, the risk of collisions leading to even more debris (Kessler Syndrome) is rising.
- High-Speed Hazards: Debris travels at velocities exceeding 7 km/s, making even small fragments potentially catastrophic upon impact.
- Limited Removal Methods: Existing mitigation strategies (such as deorbiting or moving satellites to “graveyard orbits”) are insufficient for active debris removal.

## The ODDS and FROG Approach

To address this challenge, ODDS and FROG proposes a feasible and efficient method for removing space debris by utilizing a specialized spacecraft — FROG (Feasible Remediation Orbital Gatherer) — which captures and deorbits debris in an innovative way.

1. **ODDS (Orbital Debris Deorbiting Station)**

    - Function: Serves as the only launch platform for FROG, enabling electromagnetic acceleration using an integrated Gauss gun.
    - Orbital Nature: ODDS is not stationary — it orbits Earth while slowly and continuously changing its trajectory.
    - Purpose: Coordinates space debris removal missions and provides the necessary infrastructure for deploying FROG.

2. **FROG (Feasible Remediation Orbital Gatherer)**

    - Purpose: A mobile spacecraft designed to capture and slow down space debris before deorbiting it.
    - Capture Method: Instead of robotic arms, FROG envelops debris, similar to how a frog catches a fly.
    - Energy Dissipation: Uses krypton gas from ion propulsion engines to slow down debris rotation, after which the gas is recaptured using a pump for reuse.
    - Folding Mechanism: FROG is foldable, allowing it to reduce internal space and efficiently recapture krypton gas.
    - Video Monitoring: Equipped with at least two cameras (inside and outside) to allow operators to monitor the capture process in real time.

3. **Key Relationship Between ODDS and FROG**

    - ODDS provides launch and deployment capabilities, while FROG performs the active debris capture and processing.
    - The Gauss gun on ODDS launches FROG into optimal positions for debris capture.
    - ODDS’ slowly shifting orbit allows for strategic positioning over time to maximize debris removal efficiency.

## Future Expansion: Electromagnetic Acceleration for Spacecraft

In addition to debris removal, the ODDS and FROG project also explores electromagnetic acceleration as an alternative propulsion method:

- A coilgun-based accelerator could increase the velocity of a 20 kg spacecraft by 1 km/s using electromagnetic launch principles.
- The acceleration track could be between 50 to 300 meters in length, providing a reusable boost system for small spacecraft.
- This could complement FROG’s mission by enabling rapid repositioning of spacecraft involved in debris mitigation.

## Why ODDS and FROG Matters

By combining innovative debris capture, kinetic energy dissipation, and closed-loop krypton recapture, ODDS and FROG presents a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient method for space debris mitigation.
