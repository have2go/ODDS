# ODDS â€“ Orbital Debris Deorbiting Station

ODDS serves as the central hub for space debris removal operations.

## ODDS Key Functions

1. **Electromagnetic Acceleration for FROG Deployment**

	- ODDS is equipped with a Gauss gun (electromagnetic accelerator).
	- This launches FROG to intercept targeted debris efficiently.

2. **Orbital Dynamics and Positioning**

	- ODDS orbits Earth, but unlike a stationary platform, it gradually shifts its trajectory to optimize debris removal.
	- Its trajectory allows it to be strategically positioned over time for continuous cleanup operations.

3. **Sustainable Energy System**
	- Each FROG launch requires \( 10 \text{ MJ} \) (\( 10 \text{ million joules} \)) of energy.
	- To support one launch per hour, ODDS needs a continuous power supply of \( 2.78 \text{ kW} \).
	- This is provided by \( \sim 13.89 \text{ m}^2 \) of space-grade solar panels (assuming \( 200 \text{ W/m}^2 \) efficiency).

4. **Battery System for Energy Storage**
	- A123 (26650) lithium iron phosphate (\( \text{LiFePO}_4 \)) batteries are used for energy storage.
	- Each battery provides \( 3.1 \text{ V} \) and \( 70 \text{ A} \), allowing for rapid discharge when launching FROG.
	- Total required batteries: \( 115,207 \)
	- Total battery weight: \( \sim 8.76 \text{ metric tons} \)
	- Batteries recharge within 1 hour to enable continuous hourly launches.
